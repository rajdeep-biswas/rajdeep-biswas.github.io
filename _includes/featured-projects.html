        <p>Takes in an Excel Sheet containing commodities and their expenditure histories,
           automatically connects to a remote HANA runtime via a <a href="https://pypi.org/project/hdbcli/">python wrapper</a>,
           performs iterative analysis of all available forecasting algorithms, generates & saves comprehensive plots of the predictions,
           and at the end generates a report of the best performing algorithms.
